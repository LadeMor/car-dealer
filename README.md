## Description
This app allows you to choose a car make and production year, and display information about the cars released during that year for the selected make.

On the main page, there are two dropdowns:

The first allows you to select a car make from a list by clicking on the arrow. Additionally, you can click on "Search car make" to search by typing the first letters of the make's name.

The second allows you to select a car's production year (with the default value set to 2015).
Once you select a car make, you can click on the "Next" button to proceed to a page where a list of cars released in that year for the selected make will be displayed. If no cars are found, you will see a "No result" message.
